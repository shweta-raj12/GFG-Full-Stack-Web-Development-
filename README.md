# 1. HTML
     HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, using tags to define elements such as:

1. Headings
2. Paragraphs
3. Images
4. Links
5. Forms
6. Tables

HTML is a fundamental building block of the web, working alongside CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity).

Some basic HTML elements include:

1. `<html>`: The root element
2. `<head>`: Metadata about the document
3. `<body>`: The content of the webpage
4. `<p>`: A paragraph
5. `<img>`: An image
6. `<a>`: A hyperlink

# 2. CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. It works alongside HTML to make web pages visually appealing and user-friendly.

Key Features of CSS:

1. Selectors: Target specific HTML elements to apply styles.
2. Properties: Define the styles, such as color, font, size, and layout.
3. Values: Specify the values for properties, such as `red` for color or `16px` for font size.

Benefits of CSS:

1. Separation of concerns: Keep content (HTML) separate from presentation (CSS).
2. Consistency: Apply consistent styles across a website.
3. Flexibility: Easily update styles across multiple pages.

Common CSS Concepts:

1. Box model: Understand how elements are structured (margin, border, padding, content).
2. Layout: Use techniques like flexbox, grid, or floats to arrange elements.
3. Responsive design: Use media queries to adapt styles for different screen sizes.

CSS Frameworks:

1. Bootstrap: A popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites.
2. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first framework for customizing styles.
